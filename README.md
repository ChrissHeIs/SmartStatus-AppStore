SmartStatus Watch App (MI Mod)
=====================

This is a modification of [Smartwatch+](https://github.com/robhh/SmartStatus-AppStore) that inverts the UI of the app and adds simplified music controls:
 - up button press : previous song
 - up button hold : increase volume
 - select button press : play/pause
 - select button hold : update all info
 - down button press : next song
 - down button hold : decrease volume
 
The functionality was tested only for iPhone5s Music app and is not garanteed to work in other circumstances

The SmartStatusMI watch app only works in conjunction with the Smartwatch+ iOS app. [Smartwatch+](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smartwatch+-for-pebble/id711357931?ls=1&mt=8) is available on the Apple App Store.

This code provides an example of how to communicate with Smartwatch+ and how to use status information from your iOS device within your own watch face or app. The status information that is currently available to you through Smartwatch+ is

* Current weather
* iPhone battery percentage
* Currently playing song/artist
* Next calendar appointment
